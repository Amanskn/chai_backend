    <p>This is the index.html</p>
    <p>
      This file is to test that if any index.html file is there in the folder
      which is specified in express.static middleware then that index.html will
      get rendered on home route. Got it?
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do not believe then rename me to index.js and then browse the home
      route
